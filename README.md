# Employee Attrition Prediction with RandomForest

This project builds a machine learning model to predict employee attrition based on various features in a company dataset. The primary objective is to use a classification model, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to predict the probability of attrition for each employee.

# Project Structure
The project consists of:
1. A Python script to preprocess data, train the model, evaluate it, and generate predictions.
2. Grid search to tune hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
3. Visualizations and performance metrics for a comprehensive understanding of model accuracy.
